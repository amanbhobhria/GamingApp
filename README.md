# HTML5 Gaming App

This project is an Android app built with Java, designed to enable users to play HTML5 games seamlessly. It allows games to be played both online and offline by downloading game assets from a server and storing them locally on the device. Users can experience smooth gameplay, even without internet access after the initial download. 

## Features

- Play HTML5 Games Online and Offline**: Games are fetched from a server, downloaded, and stored locally for offline access, so users can enjoy gaming anytime.
- HTML5 Game Storage**: Game files are stored on a server, then downloaded and extracted in the app's local storage, enabling offline play.
- Intuitive User Interface**: A user-friendly interface to browse, download, and play games with minimal effort.
- WebView Integration**: Games run smoothly in a WebView, offering native-like performance within the app.
